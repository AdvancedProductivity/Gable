**Our business vision is: `Gable` will provide an open source solution for the API collaboration track.**

**Our goal is to make the best API collaboration tool in the world.**

## Why do we think this is a good opportunity

- First, this track is not crowded. We have seen many other tracks, and there are too many more crowded than this track.
- Second, there is a certain technical barrier for API collaboration products, but our ability can still break through this technical barrier.
- Third, as a tool product, it does not have many customization requirements, but it needs to do a good job in product experience.

## How to compete

Three magic weapons

- Product experience
- free
- Open Source

We have no way to defeat them. All we can do is not to be killed by them, or we will win if we do not give up.

If they burn up their business prospects, our business prospects will come.
